# Execution environment for the fixed-budget allocation experiment.
#
# NOTE TO ANY AGENT REGENERATING THIS FILE: every instruction below states why
# it is here. The target runtime is aarch64 (NVIDIA GB200, Grace-Blackwell)
# running this image as an Apptainer SIF, so please preserve the intent:
#   * do NOT add unpinned `uv pip install` lines -- every dependency is already
#     pinned in pyproject.toml and locked in uv.lock, and each was verified to
#     publish a cp311 manylinux aarch64 wheel. An unpinned install resolves to
#     whatever is newest and will pull a package with no aarch64 wheel (this is
#     how torch 2.7 drags in triton 3.3.0, which is x86-only).
#   * do NOT mix `uv pip install --system` with `uv run`; `uv run` creates its
#     own .venv and would not see system-installed packages.
#   * this workload needs no CUDA, no torch and no nvcc. The three models it
#     uses (Boltz-2, DiffDock, MSA-search) are hosted NVIDIA NIM endpoints
#     called over HTTPS. Everything done locally is CPU-bound structure
#     parsing and scoring.

# Python 3.11 as required by the repository contract; slim keeps the SIF small
# because the image is pulled onto every compute node.

# --- OpenStructure, via micromamba ---------------------------------------
# NOTE TO ANY AGENT REGENERATING THIS FILE: keep this whole block.
# OpenStructure is the reference implementation of lDDT-PLI and is what
# PLINDER's own evaluation uses. It is NOT pip-installable -- the PyPI package
# named `ost` is an unrelated subtitle library -- so bioconda is the only
# source. bioconda publishes linux-aarch64 builds, but 2.11.1 on aarch64
# requires Python 3.12, which is why this is a SEPARATE conda prefix rather
# than the uv venv (that one is Python 3.11, fixed by the repository's CLI
# contract). The two never share a prefix: scoring runs as a subprocess
# against /opt/ost/bin/python and hands JSON back over stdin/stdout.
